# 🎉 BOTH ISSUES FIXED!

## ✅ Issue 1: "Join Now" Button - FIXED!

**What I did:**
Changed the header so when you're logged in:
- ❌ "Join Now" button disappears
- ✅ "Dashboard" button appears instead
- ✅ Shows "Hi, [Your Name]!"
- ✅ Shows "Sign Out" button

**When NOT logged in:**
- ✅ Shows "Sign In" button
- ✅ Shows "Join Now" button

**No action needed from you - already fixed in the code!**

## ❌ Issue 2: Registration Error - NEEDS YOUR ACTION

**The Problem:**
MongoDB is NOT connected. Look at your terminal - you DON'T see:
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

That's why registration fails!

**The Fix:**
You need MongoDB Atlas (free cloud database).

**Follow this file:** `FIX_REGISTRATION_ERROR.md`

**Quick summary:**
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register (1 min)
2. Create FREE database (2 min)
3. Get connection string (1 min)
4. Update `.env.local` (30 sec)
5. Restart app (30 sec)

**Total: 5 minutes**
